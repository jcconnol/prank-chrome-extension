# ***<u>Chrome Prankware Extension</u>***

Did your friend or coworker walk away from their computer and leave it unlocked? 
Do you want them to lose the small amount of trust they already have with you? 
Install this, choose which prank(s) you want to enable and give them a couple laughs and/or frustrations.

## ***List of Pranks***

### ***Nic Cage Pics***

With this setting turned on, any website you now go to will have every image replaced with a picture of Nicholas Cage!

### ***Doge Pics***
With this setting turned on, any website you now go to will have every image replaced with a picture of doge!


### ***No Internet***

This setting will now make your browser seem like it is having finicky internet issues. Once a website loads the entire website is then replaced with a simple replica of the Chrome "No Internet" page.

### ***Screen Flash***

Turn this on and specify an interval (say 45 seconds), at a random time during that 45 seconds the web page will flash black for about half a second.

### ***Different Mice Cursors***

When going to any website you typically like to see the normal mouse cursor or you like to be able to see your mouse cursor at all. With this enabled you can set the mouse cursor to be a specific cursor, such as none, or you can make it a random one. 
The random mouse cursors were created in an editor and will change randomly. 

### ***Windows Error***
Set a numeber between 1 and 1000 and the lower the number the less likely the person is to get a windows error when they click in a webpage.

### ***Harlem Shake***
Based on code from marcaube's harlem-shake.js (found here: https://gist.github.com/marcaube/692b5bdb99ba69b9b60f471d2721aa95), when a user clicks on the website then the Harlem Shake song starts to play and a single icon starts shaking. When that sick beat drops then almost all icons on the site shake. 

## ***Chrome Web Store***
This is not yet on the chrome Web store but that is coming in the near future so just calm down!
